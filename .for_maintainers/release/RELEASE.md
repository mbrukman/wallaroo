# Wallaroo release process

This document is aimed at members of the Wallaroo team who might be cutting a release of Wallaroo. It serves as a checklist that can take your through the release process step-by-step. Releasing is a multi-stage process, as such, this document will refer you to others for those steps.

This document does not cover testing that might need to occur during the release process beyond noting where in the process it should be done.

## Prerequisites

Prior to starting the release process, it is expected that you have successfully provisioned the Wallaroo Vagrant Release box. This process is documented in the [PROVISION_VAGRANT.md](PROVISION_VAGRANT.md) file. Once provisioned, you may continue.
